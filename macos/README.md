# Native macOS app

This directory contains the Apple Silicon application layer:

- a Swift/AppKit lifecycle and permission helper;
- a pinned, patched QEMU ARM64 runtime using HVF and Cocoa/VirGL;
- persistent-disk, input, audio-device, camera, clipboard, shared-folder, signing, and DMG tooling.

Use the root Makefile for normal development:

```sh
make runtime   # macos/.build/qemu-gpu-runtime
make app       # dist/app.noindex/Try Roguix.app
make run
make package   # signed and notarized dist/TryRoguix.dmg
make release   # signed and notarized dist/TryRoguix.dmg
make test
```

`make app` requires an existing `dist/guest/` and staged QEMU runtime. A full
`make build` creates both first.

The staged runtime is a complete, checksum-pinned Apple Silicon closure built
for macOS 15.0. Runtime and app assembly do not resolve libraries or `zstd`
from the host Homebrew prefix, so building on a newer macOS release cannot
silently raise the app's deployment target. VirGL 1.3.0 is built from source
with the pinned startergo 1.0.42 patch set and its dual-source shader regression
tests; ANGLE 1.0.16 and libepoxy 1.0.5 retain their Sequoia bottles. This keeps
the accelerated Alacritty fix without bundling the Tahoe-only VirGL bottle.

`make release` defaults to the maintainer's Developer ID Application identity
and `try-omarchy` notarytool profile. The app builder is also directly usable
for release signing and notarization:

```sh
macos/build-app.sh \
  --dmg \
  --guest-dir dist/guest \
  --sign-identity "Developer ID Application: Example (TEAMID)" \
  --notarize-profile try-omarchy
```

Local app builds are ad-hoc signed by default. To keep Accessibility and other
macOS privacy grants across rebuilds, use a stable Apple Development identity:

```sh
make run DEVELOPMENT_SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)"
```

`make package` uses `PACKAGE_SIGN_IDENTITY` and `PACKAGE_NOTARY_PROFILE`, which
default to the configured release credentials. It fails instead of producing
an unnotarized fallback.
Runtime caches are private to `macos/.build/`; user-facing output always goes
to `dist/`. The generated app lives inside `dist/app.noindex/`, which keeps a
development build from appearing beside an installed copy in Command-Space.

Normal app launches maintain one stable user VM disk under
`~/Library/Application Support/Try Roguix/VM/v1/guix`. Storage integration
tests and specialized development runs can opt into identity-keyed parallel
disks by setting `OMARCHY_QEMU_GPU_DEVELOPMENT_MULTI_DISK=1`; release behavior
leaves it unset. Each persistent disk keeps the identity of the factory that
created it and boots through the runtime's UEFI firmware from its own GRUB and
Guix System generations. App updates reuse the disk; the current bundled
factory is selected only for a new, reset, or ephemeral VM, so an existing VM
launches without first materializing the new factory disk.

Unsupported storage or boot ABIs, and ambiguous multiple legacy disks, use the
user-facing, confirmed Reset Roguix flow.
That destructive flow keeps **Reset** disabled until the user types
`Try Roguix` exactly in a native sheet. Cancelling or dismissing the sheet
returns control without invoking the storage reset.

The start menu can move that workspace to any APFS folder the user picks; the
folder is used exactly as chosen, never with a folder created inside it — a
folder with other files already in it, or a drive's top level, is refused
instead of restructured. The choice is stored in `UserDefaults` and published
to the launcher as `OMARCHY_QEMU_GPU_STATE_ROOT`. An inherited value of that
variable still wins, so the development and test override keeps working
unchanged. Reset composes its environment exactly as a launch does, so it
always erases the workspace the user is actually running.

Reset reuses the verified, identity-keyed factory cache and APFS cloning. The
validated native helper streams SHA-256 through CryptoKit, including the full
expanded factory digest on a cache miss. Each storage transaction flushes its
written files before its staging directory, then flushes the parent after the
atomic rename. This avoids repeated system-wide `sync` calls without dropping
checksums, workspace locks, or interrupted-transaction recovery. A newly created
workspace still uses one global sync to persist its marker and directory
hierarchy; standalone storage-library callers without the native helper retain
the system-tool fallback. App signature and runtime validation remain unchanged.

The Resources editor stores CPU count, RAM, and an optional maximum disk capacity in the versioned
`vmResourcePreferences` UserDefaults value. Until the first save, it adopts the
existing `memoryPreferences` choice without rewriting it. CPU choices range
from 4 through all host cores. Memory reuses `MemoryPolicy`'s 4 GiB default and
6/8/12/16 GiB choices with 8 GiB of host headroom. Saved values that no longer
fit resolve independently to their defaults without rewriting storage.

The app exports `OMARCHY_QEMU_GPU_CPUS` and the established
`OMARCHY_QEMU_GPU_MEMORY_MIB`, replacing inherited overrides with the displayed
selection. The launcher validates these before touching VM storage. Direct
script invocations retain the 2048 MiB minimum and the 4 GiB host floor for
allocations above the default. The optional `OMARCHY_QEMU_GPU_DISK_GIB` selects up to 8192 GiB of sparse
capacity. New resource settings default to 64 GiB; existing saved preferences
without a disk maximum retain their capacity. Use Defaults selects at least
64 GiB and never reduces a larger existing disk. Existing
disks grow under their workspace lock after boot pairing, using a native
helper that checks the original inode, owner, permissions, link count, and
size through the open file descriptor before extending it. No Python runtime
is needed for app-driven growth. Only boot/write headroom is required, not
the whole configured capacity. The guest grows ext4 on the next boot.
Storage-only resets strip all three resource keys; recovery
keeps its small allocation. Changes apply on the next launch without rebuilding
or re-signing the app.

Port forwarding is one versioned generic mapping list. The editor's **Add SSH**
action only inserts the ordinary TCP `2222 → 22` preset; users may edit it like
any other mapping. The signed shell parser remains the sole QEMU `hostfwd`
builder and derives boot-scoped sshd intent only from a fully valid TCP mapping
to guest port 22. No SSH-specific preference, port probe, status code, or
parallel forwarding path exists.

Ad-hoc signing identifies one exact build, so macOS intentionally invalidates
its privacy grants when that build is replaced. The app's **Open Settings**
action repairs a stale Accessibility entry and registers the installed build,
but a stable Apple Development or Developer ID signature is required for the
grant to survive future updates.

See the root `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/releasing.md` for the
supported platform, runtime boundaries, and distribution checklist.
