<h1 align="center">Try Omarchy</h1>

Run the upstream [Omarchy](https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy) desktop as a native, hardware-accelerated app on an Apple Silicon Mac.

Try Omarchy packages a project-built ARM64 Arch Linux image configured with Omarchy Quattro, a QEMU runtime using Apple Hypervisor Framework, and a small Swift/AppKit launcher into one macOS app. The image is built from pinned Arch Linux ARM packages and a pinned revision of the upstream Omarchy source. Temporary fixes carried ahead of the next upstream release are enumerated with strict hashes in the guest build spec and artifact provenance.

## Highlights

- Hardware-accelerated ARM64 virtualization and VirGL graphics
- Nested KVM virtualization on M3 and newer Apple Silicon running macOS 26+
- Resizable native window with automatic guest resolution and HiDPI scale updates
- Mac audio input/output selection inside Omarchy, with live routing and system-default fallback
- FaceTime HD and other Mac cameras exposed to Omarchy as an on-demand 720p webcam
- The Mac's battery charge and charging state mirrored into the Omarchy bar
- Two-way clipboard sharing for text and PNG images between macOS and Omarchy
- One optional shared Mac folder, available inside Omarchy under the same name (`~/Work` stays `~/Work`)
- Loopback-only TCP and UDP port forwarding from the Mac into Omarchy

> **Current limitation:** Video decoding is CPU-only, so playback can be slow, especially at high resolutions. An improved video path is in development.

## Changes in this fork

This fork moves the runtime to QEMU 11.1.1 to pick up Apple's in-hypervisor
GIC, and fixes two audio problems found along the way.

### Component versions

| Component | Upstream | This fork | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QEMU | `cf3e71d8` — 10.2.50, 2026-01-13 | `c3d48b7d` — 11.1.1, 2026-08-26 | First release carrying `hw/intc/arm_gicv3_hvf.c` |
| ARM GIC | GICv2, emulated in QEMU userspace | GICv3 via Hypervisor.framework | Removes the interrupt path from the big QEMU lock |
| Render patch | startergo mega-patch, 29 files | Vendored and trimmed to 18, forward-ported | Upstream is unmaintained since 2026-01-14 and QEMU's display API moved |
| Python build deps | Host interpreter | Pinned `setuptools`, `wheel`, `pip` wheels | QEMU 11.1 builds `qemu.qmp`, and Python 3.12+ dropped `setuptools` |
| Render patch source | Downloaded from the startergo tarball | Vendored in `macos/patches/` | That tree is unmaintained since 2026-01-14; the archive is no longer fetched at all |
| Cocoa keyboard capture | Capture follows the mouse grab | Capture follows the key window | An absolute-pointing guest drops the grab as soon as virtio-tablet binds, leaking host Command chords mid-session |

### What it fixes

**Idle CPU.** QEMU emulated GICv2 in userspace under the big QEMU lock, so
every guest interrupt cost about four lock acquisitions and every IPI about
five across two vCPU threads. The cost scaled with vCPU count and was
independent of what the guest was doing.

| Measured at idle | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| QEMU | ~65% of a core | ~15% |
| `coreaudiod` attributable to the VM | 6.4% | 0.3% |
| Total | ~71% | ~15% |

The QEMU figure moved twice: the GIC work took it to ~22%, and clearing the
Cocoa GL dirty flag (below) took it to ~15%. The second measurement was taken
on a freshly booted desktop rather than the same session, so treat the split
between the two as approximate.

Under HVF, QEMU 11.1.1 also rejects GICv2 outright, so this is now the only
supported configuration rather than an optimisation.

**A host audio device held open forever.** `sdl_enable_out` only paused the
device, and QEMU links sdl2-compat over SDL3 where pausing a logical device
leaves the physical one running. The device being held was not even from
playback — `sdl_init_out` opens one at startup purely to negotiate a format,
and nothing released it. The host resampled silence for the life of the VM.
Microphone capture is stricter: its initial device open is deferred until an
Omarchy application actually records, and the device is closed again when the
guest capture stream stops. The first recording may therefore take one device
open longer to begin, but merely launching Try Omarchy does not activate the
Mac microphone.

**An unconditional re-render every refresh tick.** The vendored
GPU-resolution patch cleared `gl_dirty` inside an `if (cocoa_gl_trace_enabled())`
block, so in a normal build the flag was never cleared: it latched true on the
first damage and `cocoa_gl_refresh` then blitted the scanout on every tick for
the life of the VM, whether or not anything had changed. The clear now sits at
function scope, where its own comment says it belongs.

**Audio dropouts.** PipeWire reported continuous xruns on a ring 682 ms deep,
with the guest driver using 17 us against a 42 ms deadline. QEMU advances the
emulated Intel HDA DMA position from a 100 Hz timer, so the counter moves in
coarse jumps and ALSA concludes it has missed. Raising the guest's quantum
gives the emulated counter fewer and larger checks to satisfy. A deeper SDL
buffer made this worse, and raising the QEMU main loop to
`QOS_CLASS_USER_INTERACTIVE` changed nothing, which rules out both buffer
depth and priority inversion.

### Graphics chain

Rendering reaches the GPU through Metal, but nothing in QEMU speaks Metal.
virglrenderer replays the guest's commands as OpenGL ES, and ANGLE translates
those into Metal, which is why the display is started with `gl=es`.

```
Hyprland / Omarchy
  |  OpenGL
  v
Mesa virgl driver                       guest
  |  command stream
  v
virtio-gpu-gl-pci  ─────────────────────────── VM boundary
  |
  v
virglrenderer                           host, replays as OpenGL ES
  |
  v
ANGLE  (libGLESv2.dylib, libEGL.dylib)  translates GL ES -> Metal
  |
  v
Metal.framework                         Apple silicon GPU
```

Two things this makes explicit. The guest sees a plain virtio GPU and needs no
Apple-specific driver. And the acceleration is real rather than a software
rasteriser: `libGLESv2.dylib` and `libEGL.dylib` link `Metal.framework`
directly, and the guest reports the renderer as
`ANGLE (Apple, ANGLE Metal Renderer: <chip>)`.

This chain is unchanged by the QEMU 11.1.1 move. That work touched the
interrupt controller and the GL scanout plumbing — how a rendered texture is
handed to the Cocoa window — not the rendering backend.

Note that the upstream tap this builds from is named
`homebrew-qemu-virgl-kosmickrisp`, but KosmicKrisp, Mesa's Vulkan-to-Metal
driver, is not part of this path.

### Not yet verified

Window resize across a HiDPI boundary, Mac output-device switching mid-session,
the shared folder, and clipboard sharing have not been exercised since the
port. The `dtc` mirror should be reverted once kernel.org returns.

## Quick start

1. Open [Releases](https://github.com/omacom/try-omarchy/releases) and download the latest signed and notarized `.dmg`.
2. Open the DMG and drag **Try Omarchy** to **Applications**.
3. Launch **Try Omarchy** from Applications.

By default, every launch begins at the start menu. Enable **Start automatically** to skip this menu on subsequent launches and start Omarchy using your saved settings. Hold **Option** while opening the app to show the menu again and change settings or turn automatic startup off. Reset requests still show the confirmation flow. Startup checks still show any required recovery or error dialogs.

While that menu is open, Try Omarchy behaves like a regular Mac app with standard Quit, Close Window, and Minimize commands; after the VM starts, that native app chrome steps aside for Omarchy. **Immersive** is on by default, so Omarchy opens Full Screen with the Mac menu bar and Dock hidden. Turn it off to open a resizable window; if you later enter Full Screen, the Mac menu bar and Dock remain available at the screen edges. Whenever the Omarchy window is focused, Command belongs to the guest as Super in either mode; Accessibility permission lets system shortcuts such as Command-Space reach it before macOS. Microphone and camera access are optional. The first launch takes longer while the app prepares Linux and starts Omarchy's account provisioning.

Inside Omarchy, choose **Setup → Try Omarchy Settings**, search for **Try Omarchy Settings**, or run `omarchy-native-settings` to reopen the Mac settings window. You can change automatic startup, permissions, CPU, memory, sharing, port forwarding, and immersive mode here. CPU, memory, sharing, ports, and immersive mode are saved for the next launch; **Restart Try Omarchy…** shuts down Linux and starts a new VM process to apply them. Save your work first. A disposable VM keeps its disk across this restart until you close the app.

For VM location and reset, choose **Shut down to manage…**. The settings window stays open even with automatic startup enabled; reset still asks for confirmation. **Done** or closing the running settings window returns to Omarchy without stopping it. Existing VMs [receive settings access automatically](guest/README.md#settings-access-from-an-existing-vm) when launched with the updated app, without a reset or manual installation.

Restarting from inside Omarchy reboots the guest in the same Try Omarchy app.
Shutting down Omarchy closes the app and leaves it closed.

## Virtual machine resources

Choose **Resources → Configure…** on the start menu to adjust processor cores
and memory, and set a maximum disk size for the next launch. Processor cores range from 4 to all the cores
on this Mac; the default remains up to 8 cores. Memory defaults to 8 GiB on
Macs with at least 16 GiB of RAM, and 4 GiB on smaller Macs. Custom allocations
can leave as little as 4 GiB for macOS; higher choices carry a performance note.

**Maximum disk size (GiB)** defaults to **64 GiB** for new launcher settings,
and supports capacities up to 8192 GiB.
Mac storage is allocated as the guest writes data, rather than reserving the
whole maximum in advance. For example, choosing 256 GiB does not immediately
use 256 GiB on the Mac. The volume still needs free space as the VM fills it;
the maximum is guest capacity, not a quota on backups or total app storage.

Leave the field blank to retain the current capacity (or the factory capacity
for a new VM). Larger values sparsely extend the stopped disk at the next
launch; the guest expands its root filesystem on boot. Existing disks cannot
shrink. **Use Defaults** selects 64 GiB, or the existing capacity if larger.
Previously saved settings without a disk maximum retain their current capacity.
A disk previously grown with the CLI remains at least that large. For direct launcher script usage,
set `OMARCHY_QEMU_GPU_DISK_GIB=256`.

**Save** remembers these choices. **Cancel** leaves them unchanged, and
**Use Defaults** restores the draft until you save. Existing memory preferences
are carried forward. A choice that no longer fits a smaller Mac falls back to
its default without erasing the saved choice.

## Ghostty

Choose **Install → Terminal → Ghostty** to download verified Ghostty sources
and build an ARM64 package inside the guest. The first build takes several
minutes and needs at least 3 GiB free. The installer uses software rendering
for compatibility with the VM. See [installation, existing VMs and limitations](docs/ghostty.md).

## 1Password

Install 1Password from the Omarchy menu. On ARM64 guests, Try Omarchy downloads
the current official 1Password application, verifies its signature against the
pinned 1Password signing key, and installs the ARM64 CLI package. Its launcher
uses software rendering to avoid the virtual GPU incompatibility affecting the
Electron interface.

After signing in, use these global shortcuts:

- `Ctrl + Shift + Space` — open 1Password Quick Access
- `Super + Shift + /` — open the full 1Password app

## Camera sharing

Choose **Allow…** next to **Camera access** on the start menu to make the Mac's
FaceTime HD camera available in Omarchy as **Mac Camera**. The bridge publishes a
standard Linux V4L2 camera at `/dev/video42`, so browser calls and Linux camera
apps can use it without special configuration. Capture is on demand: the Mac
camera and its indicator turn on only while an Omarchy app is actively using
the virtual camera. Denying camera permission does not prevent Omarchy from
launching.

## Clipboard sharing

Copy and paste work in both directions as soon as you sign in to Omarchy: text
and PNG images copied on the Mac appear in the Omarchy clipboard, and content
copied in Omarchy lands on the Mac pasteboard. Nothing is transferred until
something is copied.

## Sharing a folder with the Mac

Folder sharing is off until you pick a folder. Use **Choose…** next to
**Shared folder** on the start menu to select one Mac folder; Omarchy links it
into its home under the same name (`~/Work` on the Mac becomes `~/Work` in
Omarchy) with full read and write access, so choose a folder you intend Linux
software to modify. The whole home folder, `~/Library`, and system directories
cannot be shared. **Turn Off** keeps the choice but stops exporting it on the
next launch; Omarchy then removes the link and gives back any standard folder
such as `~/Documents` that the link had taken over. The share belongs to the
first Omarchy account created during
provisioning. Additional guest accounts can reach the same share, with each
entry's normal Unix permission bits deciding whether they can modify it.

## Networking

Use **Configure…** next to **Networking** on the start menu. **NAT** shares the
Mac's connection and is the default. **Bridged** gives the VM its own LAN
address through a selected eligible Mac interface. Changes take effect on the
next launch. Bridging uses a networking helper approved once through macOS
System Settings. Use **Set Up / Repair Networking…** to register it; subsequent
bridged launches do not request your password. QEMU continues to run as your
user. **Remove Networking Helper** unregisters the service when it is no longer
needed. Shut down any bridged VM before repairing or removing the helper.

Persistent VMs keep a stable, randomly generated bridged MAC address across app
updates, disk replacement, resizing, resets, and moves of the complete VM data
folder. Existing saved addresses are retained when upgrading from older builds.
The Networking sheet displays the address after the first bridged launch;
**Copy MAC** makes it available for a DHCP reservation. **Generate new MAC…**
shows a proposed address and requires confirmation while the VM is stopped.
This action saves immediately; DHCP reservations may need updating. Cancelling
the confirmation leaves the existing identity unchanged.

A copy of the complete VM data folder includes its network identity. To run a
copy as a separate VM, generate a new MAC before running both copies. Move or
restore the complete data folder to retain the identity; importing only a disk
into a new workspace does not transfer its network identity. Ephemeral bridged
VMs receive a fresh address on each launch. Damaged identity records produce an
error instead of silently changing the MAC. Migration and regeneration retain
the preceding record as `network-identities/current.previous.json` in the VM
data folder; restore a known-good record only with the VM stopped.

For repeated local development builds, use a consistent Apple Development
signing identity (the `DEVELOPMENT_SIGN_IDENTITY` option above). Ad-hoc-signed
helper registrations are not reliable across rebuilds on the tested macOS
version. Approval is checked separately from a working helper connection;
repair and launch verify that the helper belongs to the current app copy.

On Wi-Fi hosts that expose the compatibility control, selecting bridging
automatically enables temporary host-wide DHCP handling. The networking sheet
explains this before you save the choice. It can affect other virtualization
apps while the bridged VM runs. The previous setting is restored when the VM stops, the
app exits, or the bridge helper fails. If the privileged supervisor itself is
forcibly killed, restoration is retried on the next bridged launch. There is no
separate compatibility checkbox. NAT does not change this host setting.

Saved port-forwarding rules remain stored but are inactive in bridged mode.
Services listening on the guest network interface can be reached directly from
the LAN. **Allow SSH connections from the LAN** is a separate opt-in; switching
from a NAT SSH mapping does not enable it automatically. Guest account setup
and SSH authentication are still required. Only one bridged Try Omarchy session
can run at a time on a Mac.

If the selected adapter is unplugged, Omarchy starts offline and connects when
it returns. Unplugging and reconnecting the adapter while running also recovers
without restarting the VM. The selected adapter is preserved; the app does not
automatically switch to NAT or another interface.

## Forwarding ports to Omarchy

In NAT mode, use **Configure…** next to **Port forwarding** on the start menu to map a Mac
localhost port to a service port in Omarchy. Each mapping can use TCP or UDP;
the same Mac port may be used once for each protocol. Forwarded ports bind only
to `127.0.0.1`, so other devices on the network cannot connect to them. The
service inside Omarchy must listen on `0.0.0.0` or the guest network interface,
not only on the guest's own localhost.

The reverse direction does not need a mapping. From Omarchy, connect to
`10.0.2.2:<Mac port>` to reach a service running on the Mac.

### SSH access

After completing Omarchy's first-boot account setup, open **Port forwarding**,
choose **Add SSH**, and save the prefilled TCP mapping from Mac port `2222` to
Omarchy port `22`. Try Omarchy then requests `sshd` for boots that contain a TCP
mapping to guest port 22. It does not change guest accounts, `sshd_config`,
password policy, or authorized keys.

Connect with the username and password created inside Omarchy (the Mac username
is not assumed):

```sh
ssh -p 2222 <guest-user>@127.0.0.1
```

Once the initial password login works, install a key if desired:

```sh
ssh-copy-id -p 2222 <guest-user>@127.0.0.1
```

For a shorter command, add this to `~/.ssh/config` on the Mac:

```sshconfig
Host omarchy
  HostName 127.0.0.1
  Port 2222
  User <guest-user>
```

You can then use `ssh omarchy`, and the same alias works with `scp`, `rsync`,
Git, and VS Code Remote SSH. If you edit the preset's Mac port, substitute that
port in every command.

Factory Reset creates a new guest host key, and every ephemeral VM has its own
disposable host key. If OpenSSH reports that the key for the reused endpoint
changed, remove only that endpoint's old entry and reconnect to verify the new
fingerprint:

```sh
ssh-keygen -R '[127.0.0.1]:2222'
```

Loopback binding prevents devices on Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or the wider LAN from
connecting. It does not isolate the listener from other users or processes on
the same Mac; guest SSH authentication is still required.

### Touch ID for 1Password

An optional process-scoped integration can use the Mac's Touch ID to unlock
1Password inside the guest. Existing synced passwords and passkeys stay managed
by 1Password. See [setup and authorization boundaries](docs/onepassword-touch-id.md).

### Touch ID for sudo

Guest clock recovery handles time lost during Mac sleep so fresh signed
approvals remain usable after wake. Existing VMs need the
[guest clock recovery installer](docs/guest-clock-recovery.md).

The native authentication bridge can enroll this Mac and use
Touch ID as a sufficient authentication method for guest `sudo`. Open
**Omarchy Menu → Setup → Security → Touch ID for sudo**, or run:

```sh
try-omarchy-touch-id
```

The integration ships disabled. Enabling first requires the normal guest sudo
password, then Touch ID creates and proves possession of a Secure Enclave
signing key. Only after that succeeds is the narrowly scoped sudo PAM rule
installed. The menu then offers Test, Re-pair, and Disable actions.

The Mac stores only the Secure Enclave's device-bound encrypted key
representation. Every later approval is signed over a root-private guest ID,
fresh challenge, the sudo user and requesting user, the interactive TTY, and a
15-second validity window. Each enrolled guest has a distinct host signing key.
The QEMU window must be frontmost. Cancellation, invalid responses, missing
enrollment, and unavailable Touch ID all fall back to the normal guest password;
no login or screen-unlock PAM policy is changed.

If Touch ID falls back, sudo displays the reason before asking for the guest
password. Signed approvals require synchronized Mac and guest clocks; factory
images enable `systemd-timesyncd` at boot. On an existing guest with clock drift,
run `sudo systemctl enable --now systemd-timesyncd.service`, then check
`timedatectl` for `System clock synchronized: yes` before retrying.

The Touch ID test refuses guest-password fallback and returns failure if sudo
cannot authenticate. A passwordless sudo policy can also satisfy this check;
the result only demonstrates Touch ID when its prompt appeared. Unanswered Mac
prompts are canceled after 55 seconds, before the guest's 65-second timeout.
Late responses are discarded without extending the current request's deadline.

Enrollment persists across guest and Mac restarts for the same persistent VM,
Mac, and macOS account. Factory Reset, moving the VM to another Mac or account,
or changing the enrolled Touch ID fingerprint set requires re-pairing. Disabling
removes the guest enrollment and, while the host bridge is available, its wrapped
Secure Enclave key representation.

## Giving Omarchy more memory

Use **Resources → Configure…** on the start menu to pick how much of the Mac's
RAM the guest boots with. Macs with at least 16 GiB default to 8 GiB; smaller
Macs default to 4 GiB. The menu offers 4, 6, 8, 12 GiB and then continues in
4 GiB steps, leaving at least 4 GiB for macOS. For example, a 16 GiB Mac can
allocate up to 12 GiB, and a 48 GiB Mac up to 44 GiB. Higher choices that leave less
than 8 GiB for macOS are marked “may slow macOS.” An 8 GiB Mac offers 4 GiB only.
Existing saved choices, including 4 GiB, are preserved. The choice is not tied to installation: change it
before any launch, and it applies the next time Omarchy starts. Memory is a
boot-time QEMU setting, never part of the guest image or VM data, so switching
allocations never needs a reset and never touches your files. A stored choice
that no longer fits the Mac it runs on falls back to the default.

Unused guest memory is automatically returned to macOS through virtio free-page
reporting. Omarchy still sees the full selected RAM and can use it again when
needed. Reclamation runs asynchronously and covers genuinely free pages, not
Linux's file cache or memory still held by applications. For example, selecting
16 GiB and seeing 12 GiB used does not guarantee exactly 4 GiB returned: cache,
fragmentation, and VM overhead also affect the Mac's memory usage. Keep enough
headroom for macOS even with reclamation enabled. Updated apps enable this on the
next VM launch, including for existing VMs; no disk reset is needed.

Scripted launches can set `OMARCHY_QEMU_GPU_MEMORY_MIB` (a whole number of
MiB) instead. Scripted launches use the same host-aware default and leave
at least 4 GiB for macOS for allocations above the 4 GiB baseline. They also
accept values between menu steps, down to the guest's 2048 MiB minimum. The
4 GiB baseline remains available on smaller hosts such as CI runners.

## Traditional Chinese

Choose **Switch to Traditional Chinese (繁體中文)** next to **Language** on
the start menu to boot Omarchy in Traditional Chinese (`zh_TW.UTF-8`);
**Use English (Default)** switches back. The change takes effect on the next
launch.

Older saved VMs do not gain language support when the Mac app updates. Their
Language row stays disabled until **Reset Omarchy** creates a new factory VM.
Reset erases the VM's data; back up anything you need first. The setting remains
available for supported saved VMs across later app updates.

The desktop, file manager, browser, and system dialogs are translated, and
fcitx5 adds Chewing (Bopomofo) input, reachable with `Ctrl + Space`; the US
keyboard layout remains the default input method. Omarchy's own setup wizard
and menus stay in English either way: upstream Omarchy has no translation
mechanism, and those strings are hardcoded in its shell scripts.

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac (`arm64`)
- macOS 15 or newer
- At least 8 GB free initially

On M3 and newer Apple Silicon running macOS 26 or newer, Try Omarchy also
exposes ARM EL2 to Linux, so the guest provides `/dev/kvm` for nested VMs and
compatible VMMs. macOS 15 and older Apple Silicon Macs keep the normal
non-nested launch path. Hardware-accelerated graphics, including Alacritty,
are available on both macOS 15 and macOS 26.

## Data and updates

### Check for Mac app updates

The start menu shows the installed Mac app release and **Check for Updates…**;
the native application menu offers the same command. The update window checks
the project's latest stable GitHub release and links to its release notes and
download. Review the release's macOS requirements before installing.

**Automatically check for updates** is off by default. When enabled, opening
the app checks at most once every 24 hours; a newer release changes the start
menu link to **Update Available…**. Manual checks remain available at any time.
Checks contact GitHub without a GitHub account, and failures do not block VM
startup. This feature does not download or install app updates automatically.

Older app bundles used the same version metadata for different releases. If
the build does not include a matching release tag in its metadata, the window
reports an unknown installed release or a development build instead of claiming
that it is up to date. The latest release and manual download remain available.

To upgrade, shut down Omarchy, quit the app, download the new DMG, and replace
**Try Omarchy** in **Applications**. Reopen it to use your existing VM. You do
not need to reset or delete the VM to update the Mac app.

### Existing VM data

Normal launches keep one persistent VM under
`~/Library/Application Support/Try Omarchy/VM/v1`. Removing or updating the app
does not remove or replace this data. An existing VM keeps both its writable
disk and the exact kernel, initramfs, and base command line that were paired
with that disk. A newer app's bundled factory image is used only to create a
new VM, after a confirmed **Reset Omarchy**, or for an ephemeral launch.
Before Reset is enabled, the confirmation sheet requires typing `Try Omarchy`
exactly; cancelling the sheet returns to the start menu without changing the VM.

### Guest console log

Each persistent launch writes the guest console to
`~/Library/Application Support/Try Omarchy/VM/v1/console.log`, and moves the
previous launch's log aside to `console.log.1` first. This is the record to
read when Omarchy fails to boot, loses its network, or hangs, because a fault
that forces a reboot is otherwise gone by the time you can look. An ephemeral
launch keeps its log with the rest of its temporary state and discards it on
exit. The log holds whatever the guest prints to its console, so treat it as
guest data and review it before attaching it to a bug report.

VMs created before paired boot files were introduced are preserved too. On the
first launch that needs them, Try Omarchy explains the transition in a
**Continue** / **Cancel** dialog before starting recovery. Continue performs a
one-time recovery boot: it mounts the saved disk read-only, copies the installed
kernel and initramfs from `/boot` into private VM storage, validates them, and
then shuts the recovery boot down. It does not start the saved userspace with
the newer app's kernel, reset the VM, or upgrade Omarchy. Cancel returns to the
start menu. Reset is still required when the saved storage or boot format
itself cannot be safely read.

Use Omarchy's built-in updater for the updates it supports inside this ARM
guest. Ordinary guest packages can advance without replacing the VM, but Try
Omarchy currently pins its direct-boot kernel and headers, packaged
`try-omarchy-runtime`, and reviewed compatibility backports in a prioritized
local repository. Installing a newer Try Omarchy app therefore does not apply
all of that app's factory-image changes to an existing VM, and an in-guest
update should not be assumed to reproduce them. A confirmed reset is the
deliberate, destructive way to start again from the newest bundled factory.

### Updating integrations in an existing VM

The Mac launcher’s **VM integrations → Review…** action explains how to add
new Try Omarchy features to an existing VM. It offers a one-time setup command
for guests that do not yet have the integration manager. Run that command in an
Omarchy terminal; it mounts the app’s dedicated read-only bundle and opens a
review before requesting the Linux administrator password. SSH and personal
folder sharing are not required.

After setup, use **Omarchy Menu → Setup → Try Omarchy Integrations** or run
`try-omarchy-integrations`. The guide installs or updates the sudo Touch ID support and the
[Mac battery mirror](docs/host-battery.md#retrofitting-an-existing-guest) already bundled
with Try Omarchy. Biometric pairing remains a separate explicit choice. It does
not install pending integrations or upgrade the guest OS.

The app checks integration status after every VM launch. The launcher labels
cached results **Last check**. A guest that does not respond may need setup or
repair; a timeout is not proof that its components are absent. See
[integration updates](docs/integration-updates.md) for scope and recovery details.

### Repairing update holds in an older guest

Older guests may fail Omarchy Update with conflicting `libaquamarine.so`
dependencies. New factory images hold the compatible Hyprland, aquamarine,
and Hyprtoolkit packages together, along with the direct-boot kernel and
headers. Updating the Mac app does not add these holds to an existing guest.

Copy `guest/scripts/repair-update-holds.py` from this source checkout into the
guest, then run it **inside Omarchy**, with the updater closed:

```sh
python3 repair-update-holds.py          # preview only
sudo python3 repair-update-holds.py --apply
```

The command adds missing holds to both `/usr/share/try-omarchy/pacman.conf`
and `/etc/pacman.conf`. The first file is essential: Omarchy's pre-refresh
hook restores it over the second before updating. Existing holds, comments,
repository definitions, and unrelated settings are retained in each file.
Keep any custom settings you want to survive an update in the saved share
copy too; the existing update hook still replaces the active configuration.

The repair prints a backup directory under
`/var/lib/try-omarchy/update-holds-backup.*`, preserving both original files
under their relative paths. To undo it, close the updater and restore each
backup to its original location with `sudo cp -p`. Running the repair again
makes no changes when the holds are already present. It refuses to write
while pacman has a transaction lock.

Then retry **Update → Omarchy**. This command only repairs the hold list; it
does not install, downgrade, or upgrade packages, and cannot repair packages
that were already upgraded into an incompatible combination. If dependency
errors remain, retain the full error output for diagnosis instead of removing
the kernel or compositor holds.

### Growing an existing VM disk

To add capacity without resetting the VM, shut down Omarchy and run the
maintenance command from a source checkout on the Mac:

```sh
# Preview a new total capacity of 32 GiB.
macos/resize-vm-disk.sh --size-gib 32

# Retain a verified backup, then enlarge the stopped disk.
macos/resize-vm-disk.sh --size-gib 32 --apply
```

Run as the macOS user who owns the VM, without `sudo`. The command requires
Python 3 and an APFS volume, but does not require building the app. It uses the
same workspace lock as the launcher and refuses an active VM, shrinking,
unrecognized metadata, or a missing/invalid paired boot kit. An equal size is
a no-op. Whole-number targets up to 8192 GiB are accepted.

The default state directory is
`~/Library/Application Support/Try Omarchy/VM/v1`. For a custom VM location,
pass `--state-root "/path/to/selected-folder/VM/v1"`, using the directory that
contains `.omarchy-qemu-storage` and `disks/current`. The command does not read
the app's saved location preference or select legacy development workspaces.

The backup is an APFS clone in a private sibling directory named
`v1.resize-backup.XXXXXX`; the command prints its exact path. It retains the
original disk, disk metadata, and paired boot files and verifies the disk's
checksum before resizing; reading both full disk images can take several
minutes. Keep it until the resized VM is working. To roll back, shut down the
VM and restore its original disk from this backup; any
writes made after the backup would be lost, so preserve the newer disk first.
Never shrink the enlarged disk to undo the operation.

The host must have free space for the requested increase plus 1 GiB of
headroom. Growth is sparse, not a reservation of host capacity, and retained
clones consume additional space as their contents diverge. On the next normal
boot, the guest's enabled `systemd-growfs-root.service` grows ext4 to fill the
disk. Verify inside Omarchy with `lsblk` and `df -h /`. No app rebuild, guest
reinstall, or change to the factory image is needed.

### Choosing where the VM lives

**Change…** on the start menu's **VM Location** row moves the VM to any folder
you pick, including one on an external drive. Omarchy uses exactly the folder
you choose — it never creates a folder inside it on your behalf.

- The folder must be **empty**, or one Omarchy has already used. A folder with
  other files in it, or a drive's top level, is turned away with an
  explanation instead of being restructured; create or pick an empty folder
  (for example, one named "Try Omarchy") to use instead.
- The drive must be **APFS**. The VM disk grows as you use it, which only APFS
  supports here: on exFAT, FAT, or NTFS the same disk would claim its full size
  the moment it was created. Network volumes are refused because the VM's disk
  lock is unreliable on them. Anything else is turned away when you pick it, with
  the actual format named.
- You need roughly 7 GB free to create the VM, and up to 30 GB as it fills. The
  disk is sparse, so it only ever occupies what the guest has actually written.
- **Changing the location does not move your existing VM.** It stays where it
  is, and switching back reaches it again.
- Do not disconnect the drive while Omarchy is running. macOS refuses a normal
  eject while the VM holds the disk, but pulling the cable can damage it. If the
  volume does disappear, Omarchy shuts the VM down instead of writing on.
- **If the drive is not connected, Omarchy will not quietly use the default VM
  instead.** Launching offers to switch back to the default folder; resetting
  refuses outright, so a reset can never erase a workspace other than the one
  you confirmed. Opening the folder from the start menu will not recreate it on
  your startup disk either.

## Development requirements

- Xcode command-line tools with Swift 6
- Python 3
- `pkg-config` (Homebrew is the simplest way to install it)
- A running Docker-compatible engine that supports privileged `linux/arm64`
  containers
- Roughly 20 GB free for guest, runtime, caches, and assembled output

Install the one Homebrew build tool with:

```sh
brew install pkg-config
```

`make doctor` performs the basic preflight. `make runtime` downloads a
checksum-pinned dependency set, builds QEMU, patched libslirp, and patched VirGL
for macOS 15.0, and rejects any runtime image that raises that minimum or strongly imports an
API unavailable on the declared platform. Installed Homebrew library versions
are never copied into the app.

## Build and run

For a first full build and launch:

```sh
make build run
```

The first build downloads pinned sources, assembles a multi-gigabyte guest, and
compiles QEMU, so it can take a while. `make build` includes the basic toolchain
check. Later builds hash the effective inputs and validate the existing outputs,
then rebuild only the guest, runtime, or app components that changed. To bypass
that cache deliberately, run `make build FORCE=1` (or add `FORCE=1` to an
individual component command).

Artifacts created before their `.build/state/` record exists are rebuilt once;
the cache never adopts an output whose successful inputs it did not observe.

The generated app lives under `dist/app.noindex/`. macOS can run and package
the bundle normally, but Spotlight will not present it beside an installed
copy as a second, indistinguishable Command-Space result. The first app rebuild
after this layout change removes the old generated bundle from `dist/`.

Launching also ensures that the guest, runtime, and native app are current, so
the normal follow-up command is:

```sh
make run
```

Run the complete contract and native test suite with:

```sh
make test
```

Run `make help` for component builds, persistent-storage reset, ephemeral mode, and cleanup commands.

To reclaim development build space, run:

```sh
make clean
```

This removes all repository build output, the native and guest build caches,
and Try Omarchy's project-scoped Docker builder image and work volumes. It does
not touch a developer's persistent VM.

For a complete local reset, first quit Try Omarchy and then run:

```sh
make clean-all
```

The deep cleanup also permanently deletes the current user's Try Omarchy VM
disks and app state, plus stale Try Omarchy build and test directories in the
macOS temporary directories. It only selects Docker resources and temporary
paths owned by this project; it does not run a global Docker or system prune.
To prevent accidental data loss, the command requires an interactive terminal
and only proceeds after the developer types `clean-all` at the confirmation
prompt.

## Packaging and releases

All generated output has one predictable home:

```text
dist/
├── app.noindex/
│   └── Try Omarchy.app
├── TryOmarchy.dmg        # after make package or make release
└── guest/                # verified guest build artifacts
```

Both DMG targets create distributable artifacts:

- `make package` rebuilds the app, Developer ID-signs the app and DMG,
  notarizes the DMG with Apple, and staples the notarization tickets. It uses
  `PACKAGE_SIGN_IDENTITY` and `PACKAGE_NOTARY_PROFILE`, which default to the
  configured release credentials, and fails instead of producing an
  unnotarized fallback.
- `make release` performs the same signing and notarization workflow with the
  release-specific credential variables.

Maintainers should follow [`docs/releasing.md`](docs/releasing.md) for the full build, test, signing, license, corresponding-source, and verification checklist.
